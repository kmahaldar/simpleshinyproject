Simple shiny applications
==================================

This repo contains the R code and supporting documentation  for a simple shiny app developed for the 'Cousera - Developing Data Products ' course in the Data Science Specialization. 

The app is based on a data set airquality which is available with R.  The data set is daily air quality measurements in New York, May to September 1973.

The app allows the user to input Wind speed, temperature, month and day , then it obtain an estimated Solar R value  based on a GLM prediction algorithm generated from the original data set.  

This repo contains the following additional files:
1. ui.R used to generate the shiny app
2. server.R second file needed to generate the shiny app
3. Project_Description.md  description of the project (this document contains a small user guide section)
